# Styling
We have a set of recogmended styling rules to help keep the code looking neat. Pull requests that badly follow the styling will not be accepted.

## Naming
All variables and functions should use PascalCase which is where you have all words capitalised such as IsMoving but NOT isMoving.

## Comments
When writing comments prefer comments on the same line as the code saying what the line does. If it is a large block of code (not a function, put the comment as the same line as the declaration of the function) put it above the block.

## Formatting 
We use the default vscode formatter which is clang_format. Please do not use any other formatter because it means that the diff will be hard to use.
